Here’s a step-by-step guide for prompting an AI to implement the outlined updates:  

---

### **1. State Synchronization**  
**Objective:** Ensure state is synchronized across components to reflect accurate ordering.  

**Steps:**  
- Create an event-based state management system.  
  - **Prompt:** *"Develop an event-based state synchronization system where components can subscribe to changes in order state."*  
- Track the physical position of items.  
  - **Prompt:** *"Add logic to track the physical positions of items in a list and update the state accordingly."*  
- Update the database structure.  
  - **Prompt:** *"Modify the database schema to store item positions explicitly, ensuring updates reflect the order correctly."*  

---

### **2. Order Management**  
**Objective:** Implement proper sorting and maintain order consistency across reloads.  

**Steps:**  
- Assign order numbers based on physical positions.  
  - **Prompt:** *"Implement logic to assign sequential order numbers to items based on their physical position in a list."*  
- Sort items using order numbers.  
  - **Prompt:** *"Add a sorting function that organizes items based on their order numbers in ascending order."*  
- Save order persistently.  
  - **Prompt:** *"Implement a save feature to persist order changes in the database and reload them accurately."*  

---

### **3. Visibility & Structure**  
**Objective:** Extend visibility and structure controls to all hierarchical levels.  

**Steps:**  
- Add visibility toggles for sections, subsections, and fields.  
  - **Prompt:** *"Create visibility toggle options for each level (sections, subsections, and fields) in the column management component."*  
- Ensure updates cascade through the hierarchy.  
  - **Prompt:** *"Implement cascading visibility updates, so toggling a parent affects all its children."*  
- Maintain a consistent structure for each hierarchy level.  
  - **Prompt:** *"Develop logic to ensure the structural hierarchy remains intact when making visibility changes."*  

---

### **4. Database Updates**  
**Objective:** Ensure atomic and consistent updates with error handling.  

**Steps:**  
- Implement atomic updates for order changes.  
  - **Prompt:** *"Write a database transaction script to atomically update item positions and handle errors gracefully."*  
- Rollback changes on failure.  
  - **Prompt:** *"Add error-handling logic to rollback database changes if an update operation fails."*  
- Add event emission for state updates.  
  - **Prompt:** *"Emit events after database updates to notify components of state changes."*  

---

### **5. Performance Enhancements**  
**Objective:** Optimize performance for smoother UI and better error handling.  

**Steps:**  
- Implement optimistic updates.  
  - **Prompt:** *"Enable optimistic UI updates for order and visibility changes while awaiting database confirmation."*  
- Add proper state management to minimize redundant operations.  
  - **Prompt:** *"Optimize state management to avoid unnecessary re-renders or data fetching."*  
- Handle data loading and errors.  
  - **Prompt:** *"Add error messages and fallback UI for scenarios where data fails to load or sync."*  

---

### **6. Modify the Overview Page**  
**Objective:** Reflect new order and visibility logic on the Overview page.  

**Steps:**  
- Fetch updated data with order and visibility.  
  - **Prompt:** *"Update the Overview page to fetch and display items according to their new order and visibility settings."*  
- Add UI to indicate item visibility and structure.  
  - **Prompt:** *"Design the Overview page UI to clearly show hierarchical structures and visibility toggles."*  
- Sync updates made on the Overview page back to the database.  
  - **Prompt:** *"Ensure changes made on the Overview page (order, visibility) are reflected in the database."*  

---

### **Additional Feature Implementation**  
**Ask for more specific features:**  
- “Would you like detailed database queries for atomic updates?”  
- “Do you want additional UI components for better visualization of hierarchy?”  
- “Should we include undo/redo options for order and visibility changes?”
